# Pandas Challenge

Please see the attached documents which include jupyter notebook script and the rescourses. 

This challenge was to create and manipulate Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data. To do this, two csv files containg data were read and then pandas were used to merge the files together and analyze the data based on a variety of factors. 

## Py City School Summary
* As a whole, schools with lower budgets, yielded better test results. By contrast, schools with smaller budgets (585 per student) actually outperformed schools with higher spending (645-675 per student).
* As a whole, smaller and medium sized schools dramatically out-performed large sized schools on overall passing performances (89-91% passing vs 58%).
* As a whole, charter schools out-performed the public district schools across all metrics. However, more analysis will be required to glean if the effect is due to school practices or the fact that charter schools tend to serve smaller student populations per school.
